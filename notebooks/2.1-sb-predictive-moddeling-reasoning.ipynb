    "\n",
    "Our dataset is influenced by two interacting temporal phenomena. First, concept drift, which could be driven by for example the 2008 financial crisis, has rendered older data less predictive of current outcomes. Second, we observe a temporal instance imbalance, where this outdated 2008-era data is overrepresented in volume. While each issue is problematic on its own, their combination is especially harmful: the volume imbalance significantly amplifies the negative impact of the drift. To address this, we apply time-based sample weighting — not to equalize instance counts, but to rebalance the influence of different time periods. This ensures the model prioritizes learning from more recent, and therefore more relevant, observations.\"\n"
